Question 1:  Review the options under Build Triggers.  Why might you want to set up your build to trigger "after other projects are built" or use a GitHub webhook to poll git?
Answer:  This build may have dependencies on others so that they would need to be built first. The webhook could poll git and if changes are found a build could be initiated to incorporate the git changes. 

Question 2:  Review the options under Build Environment.  Why might you want to delete the workspace before the build starts?  
Answer:  To ensure you are starting with a clean build workspace/environment.  

Question 3:  Where will the script we specified run when the build job is executed?  (Recall that this is a dockerized Jenkins instance)
Answer:  Local to the jenkins docker
